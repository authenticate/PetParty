Advanced Tutorial - (For Training Pets)
---------------------------------------

1.) Follow the Basic Tutorial to create an initial pet party for battling a daily quest tamer NPC.

2.) Drag and drop two battle pets from Blizzard's Pet Journal into the Battle Pet Slots' Configuration.  These two pets should be designed to beat all three of the tamer's pets.  (For example, using Farmer Nishi as an examle, use Dancing Water Skimmer and Darkmoon Zeppelin.)

3.) Drag and drop a battle pet to level from Blizzard's Pet Journal into the Training Pet frame at the top of the Pet Party UI.

4.) Drag and drop the Training Pet frame into the final slot of the Battle Pet Slots' Configuration.

5.) Click Save to store the pet party.
Note: This will save a Training Pet as the final pet in this pet party and not the pet itself.  So, changing the Training Pet will automatically update all pet parties with the Training Pet.
